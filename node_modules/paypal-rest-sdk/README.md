Repository for PayPal's Node SDK (node.js version >=0.6.x) and Node samples for REST API. For a full working app and documentation, have a look at the [PayPal Node SDK Page](http://paypal.github.io/PayPal-node-SDK/).

> **2.0 Beta**: We now have a 2.0 beta available, featuring promise support, and a revamped integration. Check out the [`2.0-beta`](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-node-SDK/tree/2.0-beta) branch for details, or run `npm install paypal-rest-sdk@beta`.

> **v1.0.0 notice**: If upgrading from paypal rest sdk 0.*, Please view Breaking Changes in release_notes.md

> **The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Council has [mandated](http://blog.pcisecuritystandards.org/migrating-from-ssl-and-early-tls) that early versions of TLS be retired from service.  All organizations that handle credit card information are required to comply with this standard. As part of this obligation, PayPal is updating its services to require TLS 1.2 for all HTTPS connections. At this time, PayPal will also require HTTP/1.1 for all connections. See the [PayPal TLS Update repository](https://github.com/paypal/tls-update) for more information.**

> **TLSv1_2 warning: Due to PCI compliance, merchant servers using a version of TLS that does not support TLSv1_2 will receive a warning.

> **To verify that your server supports PCI compliant version of TLS, test against the PayPal sandbox environment which uses TLS 1.2.

## Direct Credit Card Support
> **Important: The PayPal REST API no longer supports new direct credit card integrations.**  Please instead consider [Braintree Direct](https://www.braintreepayments.com/products/braintree-direct); which is, PayPal's preferred integration solution for accepting direct credit card payments in your mobile app or website. Braintree, a PayPal service, is the easiest way to accept credit cards, PayPal, and many other payment methods.

## Installation

```sh
npm install paypal-rest-sdk
```

## Usage
To write an app using the SDK

  * Register for a developer account and get your client_id and secret at [PayPal Developer Portal](https://developer.paypal.com).
  * Add dependency 'paypal-rest-sdk' in your package.json file.
  * Require 'paypal-rest-sdk' in your file

    ```js
    var paypal = require('paypal-rest-sdk');
    ```
  * Create config options, with parameters (mode, client_id, secret).

    ```js
    paypal.configure({
      'mode': 'sandbox', //sandbox or live
      'client_id': 'EBWKjlELKMYqRNQ6sYvFo64FtaRLRR5BdHEESmha49TM',
      'client_secret': 'EO422dn3gQLgDbuwqTjzrFgFtaRLRR5BdHEESmha49TM'
    });
    ```
  * For multiple configuration support, have a look at the [sample](/samples/configuration/multiple_config.js)
  * Invoke the rest api (eg: create a PayPal payment) with required parameters (eg: data, config_options, callback).

    ```js
    var create_payment_json = {
        "intent": "sale",
        "payer": {
            "payment_method": "paypal"
        },
        "redirect_urls": {
            "return_url": "http://return.url",
            "cancel_url": "http://cancel.url"
        },
        "transactions": [{
            "item_list": {
                "items": [{
                    "name": "item",
                    "sku": "item",
                    "price": "1.00",
                    "currency": "USD",
                    "quantity": 1
                }]
            },
            "amount": {
                "currency": "USD",
                "total": "1.00"
            },
            "description": "This is the payment description."
        }]
    };
    
    
    paypal.payment.create(create_payment_json, function (error, payment) {
        if (error) {
            throw error;
        } else {
            console.log("Create Payment Response");
            console.log(payment);
        }
    });
    ```

  * For creating [Subscription Payments](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/create-billing-plan/), check out the [samples](/samples/subscription) for creating planned sets of future recurring payments at periodic intervals.

  * To create [Future Payments](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/mobile/make-future-payment/), check out this [sample](/samples/payment/create_future_payment.js) for executing future payments for a customer who has granted consent on a mobile device.

  * For [exploring additional payment capabilites](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/explore-payment-capabilities/), such as handling discounts, insurance, soft_descriptor and invoice_number, have a look at this [example](/samples/payment/create_with_paypal_further_capabilities.js). These bring REST payment functionality closer to parity with older Merchant APIs.

  * Customizing a [PayPal payment experience](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/payment-experience/) is available as of version 1.1.0 enabling merchants to provide a customized experience to consumers from the merchantâ€™s website to the PayPal payment. Get started with the [supported rest methods](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/payment-experience/) and [samples](/samples/payment_experience/web_profile).

  * For creating and managing [Orders](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/payments/create-process-order/#create-the-order), i.e. getting consent from buyer for a purchase but only placing the funds on hold when the merchant is ready to fulfill the [order](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/payments/#order), have a look at [samples](/samples/order).

  * For creating [batch and single payouts](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/payouts/), check out the samples for [payouts](/samples/payout) and [payout items](/samples/payout_item). The [Payouts feature](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/payments.payouts-batch/) enables you to make PayPal payments to multiple PayPal accounts in a single API call.

  * For [Invoicing](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/invoicing/), check out the [samples](/samples/invoice/) to see how you can use the node sdk to create, send and manage invoices.

  * To receive [notifications from PayPal about Payment events](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/webhooks/) on your server, webhook support is now available as of version 1.2.0. For creating and managing [Webhook and Webhook Events](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/webhooks/), check out the [samples](/samples/notifications/) to see how you can use the node sdk to manage webhooks, webhook events and [verify](/samples/notifications/webhook-events/webhook_payload_verify.js) that the response unaltered and is really from PayPal. Please follow the [Webhook Validation](samples/notifications/webhook-events/webhook_payload_verify.js) sample to understand how to verify the authenticity of webhook messages. It is also important to note that simulated messages generated using the [Webhook simulator](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/webhooksSimulator) would not be compatible with the verification process since they are only mock data.

  * To use OpenID Connect

    ```js
    // OpenID configuration
    paypal.configure({
      'openid_client_id': 'CLIENT_ID',
      'openid_client_secret': 'CLIENT_SECRET',
      'openid_redirect_uri': 'http://example.com' });

    // Authorize url
    paypal.openIdConnect.authorizeUrl({'scope': 'openid profile'});

    // Get tokeninfo with Authorize code
    paypal.openIdConnect.tokeninfo.create("Replace with authorize code", function(error, tokeninfo){
      console.log(tokeninfo);
    });

    // Get tokeninfo with Refresh code
    paypal.openIdConnect.tokeninfo.refresh("Replace with refresh_token", function(error, tokeninfo){
      console.log(tokeninfo);
    });

    // Get userinfo with Access code
    paypal.openIdConnect.userinfo.get("Replace with access_code", function(error, userinfo){
      console.log(userinfo);
    });

    // Logout url
    paypal.openIdConnect.logoutUrl("Replace with tokeninfo.id_token");
    ```

## Running Samples
Instructions for running samples are located in the [sample directory](/samples).

## Running Tests
To run the test suite first invoke the following command within the repo

If [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) is not installed:
```sh
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

If [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) is not installed:
```sh
npm install -g mocha
```

To install the development dependencies (run where the `package.json` is):
```sh
npm install
```

Run the tests:
```sh
grunt test (timeout is specified in milliseconds eg: 15000ms)
```

To run the tests without the mocks:
```
NOCK_OFF=true mocha -t 60000
```


## Debugging
   * As of version 1.6.2, full request/response are logged for non production environments with PAYPAL_DEBUG set

     You can set the environment variable on the command line by running `PAYPAL_DEBUG=1 node <path of script>` or by executing `export PAYPAL_DEBUG=1` and then running your Node.js script. Please see your command terminal/shell's manual pages for specific information.

   * It is recommended to provide Paypal-Debug-Id if requesting PayPal Merchant Technical Services for support. You can get access to the debug id by setting environment variable PAYPAL_DEBUG=1.
   * The error object returned for any bad request has error.response populated with [details](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/payments/#errors). PAYPAL_DEBUG=1 setting also gives you access to stringfied response in error messages.
